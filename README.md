# PRODIGY_DS_03
In this notebook, we worked with a bank-related dataset to analyze customer behavior. We started by importing libraries like pandas and numpy to load and explore the data. After loading the dataset, we used descriptive statistics to understand key features such as age, job type, and account balances. The data was cleaned and then split into training and testing sets, preparing it for predictive modeling. To visualize the data, we employed bar charts to represent categorical variables like job distribution and box plots to examine numerical data such as customer balance.
